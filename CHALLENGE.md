## Le Petite Patisserie

You work as a DevOps Engineer for a small development house and the lead engineer on a client, Le Petite Patisserie, has left the company. 

The application is in the early stage of development and you have that engineer's to-do list available in the objectives below. These are now your tasks.

# Objectives

1. Write a Dockerfile that containerises the backend application and update the documentation for running it in `backend/README.md`.
2. Write a Docker Compose file that can be used to run both the backend and frontend containers with one command and document how to use it in the `README.md` in the root of the repository. Both containers should be able to communicate with each other.
3. How would you test the functionality of the running applications? Please write your answer in the answers section of `CHALLENGE.md` and implement your suggestions if you feel comfortable doing so. 
4. If you stop the applications using `docker compose down` and start them again using `docker-compose up`, you will see errors in the logs from the backend. Why is that? How would you fix this problem? Please write your answer in the answers section of `CHALLENGE.md` and implement the fix if you feel comfortable doing so.
5. Le Petit Patisserie now wants to deploy these applications to production. How would you achieve this? What deployment paradigm and tools would you use to do so? Please go into detail and include an architecture diagram with your submission. Assume that the applications will be deployed to AWS (although if you are more familiar with another cloud provider, that's okay too).
